The CCP is designed to provide support and advocacy for persons with SMI thorough interaction with non-professional companions. The core of the program is its flexibility. The exact nature of the client/companion activities is determined by the needs of the client, but might include skills-building in activities of daily living, or advocacy with various entitlement programs.
