# Token constraints

The simplest possible Odinson patterns consist of a single token constraint. A token constraint specifies what must be true of a token in order for it to be a valid extraction.  These constraints are limited only by what you include in your index.  For example, we commonly include part of speech tag, named entity information (NER), and chunk.

## Example

If you write a query such as this:

    dog

Odinson will look for any occurrence of the word `dog`.  Unless specified otherwise, this will be *case-insensitive* and will normalize accents and unicode characters.  That is, this pattern will match: `dog`, `DoG`, and `d√∂g`.

## Using the token fields

If you want to write a token constraint that uses the indexed fields, you can use this format:

    [tag=/N.*/]
    
    
This pattern will match any token in a document whose part of speech tag begins with "N".  Here, `tag` is the specified field of the constraint.  Any token constraint with an unspecified field (e.g., `dog` in the above example) will be matched against the `norm` field, which is the default.  That is, `dog` is equivalent to `[norm=dog]`.  The field names are specified [here](https://github.com/lum-ai/odinson/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf), and for most use cases should not need to be modified.

## Operators for token constraints

You can combine and nest constraints for a token using operators: `&` (for AND), `|` (for OR) and parentheses. For example, the following would match a word whose tag starts with "N" and which is also tagged as an organization using NER or is a proper noun.

    [tag=/N.*/ & (entity=ORGANIZATION | tag=NNP)]
    
## Wildcards

Odinson supports wildcards for token constraints.  Specifically, 
 - `[]` : any token
 
## Quantifiers 

Like any other pattern component, token constraints (as well as these wildcards) can be combined with [quantifiers](quantifiers.html), e.g., 
    
    [chunk=B-NP] [chunk=I-NP]*
