# Overview  
  
This repository contains the code for Odinson, a powerful and highly optimized open-source framework for information extraction.  Odinson is a rule-based information extraction framework, which couples a   simple, yet powerful pattern language that can operate over multiple  representations of text, with a runtime system that operates in near real time.   
  
In the Odinson query language, a single pattern may combine regular   expressions over surface tokens with regular expressions over graphs   such as (but not limited to) syntactic dependencies.   

To guarantee the rapid matching of these patterns, the framework   indexes most of the necessary information for matching patterns,   including directed graphs such as syntactic dependencies, into a custom Lucene index. Indexing minimizes the amount of expensive pattern matching that must take place at runtime.   
  
Odinson is designed to facilitate real-time (or near real-time) queries over surface, syntax, or both.   The syntax is based on that of its predecessor language, Odin, but there are some key divergences, detailed here.

To guarantee the rapid matching of these patterns, our framework indexes most of the necessary information for matching patterns, including directed graphs such as syntactic dependencies, into a custom Lucene index. Indexing minimizes the amount of expensive pattern matching that must take place at runtime. As a result, the runtime system matches a syntax-based graph traversal in 2.8 seconds in a corpus of over 134 million sentences, nearly 150,000 times faster than its predecessor.},
